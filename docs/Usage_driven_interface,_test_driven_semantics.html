<h1>Usage driven interface, test driven semantics</h1><h5>The problem</h5>

<p>
I need a class <i>A</i> to provide service <i>a</i> for me. First I create <i>ATest</i> and
specify some of the wanted behaviour of <i>A</i> there. Then I start
implementing <i>A</i>. All is well, I let <i>ATest</i> drive all the development.
</p>
<p>
Then, during the implementation of <i>A</i> I start to realize that in order to
fulfill its task <i>A</i> needs to delegate a subtask to a new class, <i>B</i>. Now,
it's clearly the implementation of <i>A</i> that drives the development of <i>B</i>.
But, according to the principle of test driven development, shouldn't I
first create <i>BTest</i> that drives the development of <i>B</i>?
</p>
<p>
If I do, which one is driving the development of <i>B</i>, <i>A</i> or <i>BTest</i>? (Of
course, ultimately it's <i>ATest</i> that's driving, but if <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are big
enough units, that's not enough.)
</p>
<p>
If the former, I'm not doing test driven development. If the latter, how
can I make sure the resulting <i>B</i> satisfies the needs of its client <i>A</i>? Or
should they both drive at the same time, which means a lot of
context-switching (both mental and concrete) and duplicating code between <i>A</i>
and <i>BTest</i>?
</p>
<p>
The question isn't just theoretical, it's very practical. When applying
the principle of <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wipu?entry=coding_by_need">coding by need</a> , it's the driving code from which
I create and navigate to the production code under modification.
</p>
<p>
Where should I press ctrl-1 to create <i>B</i> or one of its methods? Where
should I ctrl-click to navigate to it so I can make it work?
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the two questions above give a hint to a solution: two
driver candidates and two questions...
</p>

<h5>The solution</h5>

<p>
The primary need that justifies the creation of <i>B</i> is in <i>A</i>. So I code by
intention and write the algorithm in <i>A</i> that needs <i>B</i>, using ctrl-1 to
create a stub <i>B</i>, never really mentally leaving <i>A</i>. Eclipse will create
TODO comments in the stub <i>B</i> so that I won't forget to test and fix <i>B</i> even if the
default "return null" happens to work for <i>A</i>.
</p>
<p>
So far <i>A</i> has driven the creation of the <i>B</i> <u>interface</u> (in this context
interface is more or less a synonym for signature).
</p>
<p>
Now when I have one client for the new service that <i>B</i> provides, it's
time to think more about the service and try to find the general
contract its interface implies. This is where <i>BTest</i> takes over and
starts to drive the <u>semantics</u> or implementation of the newly created interface.
</p>
<p>
Put another way, <i>A</i> serves as a prototype that sketches one usage
scenario for <i>B</i>. Most of the do-undo-redo work probably happens here.
This prototype gives enough insight of the nature of <i>B</i> so it's
straightforward to make all assumptions as general and explicit as
possible by writing them as tests in <i>BTest</i>.
