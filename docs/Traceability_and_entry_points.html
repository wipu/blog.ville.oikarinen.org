<h1>Traceability and entry points</h1>
<p>
<i>Traceability</i> is a kind of <a href="http://blog.ville.oikarinen.org/Walking_on_red_carpet.html">red carpet</a> (or maybe green?) for learning to understand code. Ideally you can trace the code <i>statically</i>, by reading and ctrl-clicking calls. Polymorphism reduces traceability, but when used wisely, it's a very acceptable compromise. Inheritance also reduces traceability, but it's also difficult to use wisely :)
</p>

<p>
The second best form of traceability is <i>dynamic</i>: when debugging, you can trace even polymorphic method calls.
</p>

<p>
But, to be able to set break points for debugging, you need to know the <i>entry points</i>. The problem with typical enterprise code is that it has a lot of them, and you need to dig through a pile of XMLs and specifications to find them all. Even if you happen to have the container sources at hand, many calls are hidden behind reflection.
</p>

<p>
Tracing enterprise code statically is virtually impossible, but you can at least <i>list all the entry points</i> in one place. Create a documentation module that depends on all other modules and write an entry point document in Java. Just print the entry point classes/resources to stdout or something, and maybe even put some explanatory text in between. This file will be the only entry point for static tracing, verified by the compiler.
</p>

<p>
The long-term solution is of course to reduce the number of entry points. You don't have to use all those bells and whistles: just add one Plain Old Method Call instead of declaring an interceptor, for example. No more code needed (in fact, Java is even less noisy than XML), but a huge improvement on traceability.
