<h1>Test the zero case first</h1><p>
When starting a new "unit of test" (method, interface, module, ...), the first test to write should define its behaviour in the "zero case" i.e. when zero/null/empty goes in, or out.
</p>

<p>
First, the zero case is often the easiest to implement. Just return "zero", throw an exception or something like that. And because the feature itself is easy, it is effective at <i>driving</i> the creation of the new unit, satisfying dependencies in the test environment and otherwise getting started.
</p>

<p>
Second, the zero case is often a nasty <i>boundary case</i> that gets overlooked without the test. Sometimes (often with collections) it is automatically OK, but too often it is not.
