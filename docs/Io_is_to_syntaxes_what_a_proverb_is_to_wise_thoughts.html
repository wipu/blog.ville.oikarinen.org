<h1>Io is to syntaxes what a proverb is to wise thoughts</h1>	<p><a href="http://www.iolanguage.com" title="">Io </a>seems like a very promising language (or if the community won&#8216;t grow for some reason, at least it will be a good concept to build upon).</p>

	<p>There are lots of nice things about it (like prototypes), but what I liked most is its syntax: it is minimal (=machine-handleable) but readable. It reminds me of the Mathematica language, in which everything is a statement.</p>

	<p>And it&#8216;s really pure <span class="caps">OOP</span>: even the code itself consists of objects. Could Io finally be &#8220;the one&#8221;: <span class="caps">LISP</span> power with a human-readable syntax!</p></div>
