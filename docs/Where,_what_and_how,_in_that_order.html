<h1>Where, what and how, in that order</h1><p>
Before a client can tell us what he wants done, he must tell <i>where</i> (the version of the "bin") he wants it done.
</p>

<p>
Then he tells what he wants (This is <i>just</i> specifications, stories, communication, analysis etc).
</p>

<p>
Before we can do it, we must know <i>where</i> (the version of the "src") it should be done.
</p>

<p>
Then we do it (This is <i>just</i> languages, architecture, design, methodologies etc)
</p>

<p>
After we have done it, we must get a new "bin" from the "src" and deliver it to the client.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards we must be able to track who requested what (<i>where</i> is the request?) to <i>where</i>, how it was done (<i>where</i> is the diff?) and what got delivered to the client (<i>where</i> is the "bin" and a recipe to create it again?).
</p>

<p>
<i>
Software Configuration Management is a reliable mapping between what a client sees and what a programmer sees.
