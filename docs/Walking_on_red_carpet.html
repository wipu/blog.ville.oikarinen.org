<h1>Walking on red carpet</h1><p>
I like to think of <a href="http://blog.ville.oikarinen.org/Coding_by_need.html">coding by need</a> as <i>walking on a red carpet</i> from a problem to its solution. A friendly test failure or compilation error message nicely points to the next problem that needs the programmer's attention.
</p>

<p>
It is almost always possible and feasible to drive development with an end-to-end "automated user story" that will stay red until the story is really done. But sometimes the intermediate reds like lower-level unit tests and compilation errors all turn green and leave the programmer wondering what to do next. Searching for the next carpet fragment by reading design documentation.
</p>

<p>
One way to measure code design is to count the number of gaps in the carpet when implementing a story. In the ideal case the compiler and test messages will guide the programmer from start to finish, and virtually no (other) documentation is needed.
</p>

<p>
Premature green is another root of all evil.
