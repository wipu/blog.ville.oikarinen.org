<h1>Server-client is a deployment model, not architectural</h1>
<p>
Separating interface and implementation is a good old principle,
but surprisingly often it is violated.
</p>

<p>
Maybe one reason for this is the misunderstood role of the server-client model.
</p>

<p>
The server-client model is a <i>deployment</i> model. Or in other words, it describes the runtime properties of an application.
</p>

<p>
However, in software architecture (in the source-code maintainability sense) these two layers are not enough. The server
needs to be split into two: the api and its implementation.
</p>

<p>
So the "minimal" set of modules for a client-server application is client-api-apiimpl.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there can be several client and server implementations, but 3 is the minimum number of modules.
