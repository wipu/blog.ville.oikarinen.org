<h1>Coding by need</h1><p>
Test driven development essentially means that the only legitimate reason to write code
is a failing test.
</p>

<p>
I think this same "laziness" principle applies on the coding level, too: Failing compilation should be the only legitimate reason to create/modify classes and methods.
</p>

<p>
In practice this means that in general you should first write the call and only then the called class or method. I call this <i>quickfix coding</i> (from the quickfix feature of Eclipse).
</p>

<p>
This relates closely to the <i>coding by intention</i> principle mentioned in some XP book (maybe <i>XP installed</i>).
Coding by intention helps in keeping your thoughts in one thing at a time. Furthermore it produces more readable code.
</p>

<p>
Quickfix coding is more economic, too: you need fewer keystrokes as the IDE creates the signature for you. And you'll rarely need to manually open files or keep several of them open: if you start from the caller, you can always ctrl-click the call to open the called file and close it after the modification.
</p>

<p>
I think <i>Coding by need</i> is a nice common name for TDD and Quickfix coding.
