<p>
Next time I get a heap of pseudo-formal structured specification documents instead of user stories telling what the user really wants, I might try a lesson from a field older than ours:

Most good engineers don't want a technical explanation from the driver.
They want a detailed explanation of how the car feels.
So, learn how to tell what the car is doing, not why.
This will make you a better race driver.
