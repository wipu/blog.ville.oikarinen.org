<h1>Eagerly find dish machines to empty</h1>
<p>
In general it's wise to be lazy. <i>Don't do it (yet)</i>, <i>You Ain't Gonna Need It</i>, <i>Don't Repeat Yourself</i> etc.
</p>

<p>
But the exception is <i>tasks that open new ways to be lazy</i>. Or, put the other way, tasks that cause you more work if delayed. 
</p>

<p>
Emptying the dish machine is one such task: if you delay it, you'll start piling dirty dishes, and before you know, you don't know where to put things. You've got a mess that generates more mess.
</p>

<p>
I think most SCM-related tasks belong to this category. Solving even a small problem in SCM gives easily more leverage than a moderate design refactoring.
