<h1>Learning by overdoing</h1><p>
Information Technology, the traditional view: automated, fast, repeatable, scalable, universal. Interconnected concepts and derivation of new ones.
</p>
   
<p>
Information Technology, the agile view: simple, concrete, immediate, temporary, specific.
</p>

<p>
After years of over-engineering, rigid analysis and technological overoptimism,
this new lowtech movement is a refreshing antithesis that helps us concentrate on the essential.
<i>It's not about technology, it's about getting things done.</i>
</p>

<p>
Still, haven't we already learnt the lesson? Could we move on and apply it to our actual profession?
</p>

<p>
<i>
We are selling automation so it's best we get back into using it ourselves.
</i>
If low tech solutions really work better, haven't we failed as creators of helpful technology?
</p>

<p>
If we delay the adoption of scalable solutions, are we ready when the time comes they are really needed?
</p>

<p>
I admit I am a repeatability and automation geek. I hate having to remember things. I feel uncomfortable when I do something I know I cannot repeat.
Still, I believe that by consistently trying to use scalable tools before falling back to mouse-clicking and paper-tossing, I increase or at least maintain my skills so I'm at my full
capacity whenever they are needed.
</p>

<p>
I'm suffering some constant inconvenience in hope to minimize inconvenience with requirements worse than O(1). And the constant is decreasing all the time :)
