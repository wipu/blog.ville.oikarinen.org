<h1>My shell scripts start to get infected with meta</h1><p>
Recently I have discovered that my metaprogramming efforts have started to infect (<a href="http://blog.ville.oikarinen.org/You_are_what_you_feed_your_brain_with.html">you are what you feed your brain with</a>) my way of writing shell scripts.
</p>
<p>
Earlier it felt dirty and "non-unixy" to generate temporary shell scripts. I felt pride every time I managed to avoid it using xargs, find -exec, functions, loops etc.
</p>
<p>
Now it feels quite good to process a set of files by generating separate commands for each file, piping them first to less for manual reviewing and finally to a new bash for execution. And it feels even better to manipulate the script with sed.
