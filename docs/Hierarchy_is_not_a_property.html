<h1>Hierarchy is not a property</h1><p>
There are many cases where an item contains a property that defines its location inside a hierarchy:
<ul>
<li>In HTML a header element defines its own location in the (assumed) hierarchy of headers: an H1 header is "higher" than an H2 header.</li>
<li>Latex sections also define their own level: there are sections, subsections and subsubsections.</li>
<li>Java source files define their own package, and the information is usually redundantly reflected in the directory hierarchy, too.</li>
</ul>
   
<p>
This is an antipattern. The location in a hierarchy is not a property of the contained object.
Instead, <i>the location in a hierarchy is simply defined by the location in a hierarchy.</i>
</p>
<p>
If the parent-child relationship is defined <i>only</i> by an attribute in the child object, this is not a problem. One-to-many relationships in SQL are typically
defined like this. (Technically references are often stored in both ends of a relationship, especially in volatile run-time objects, but this is just an optimization, hidden under the hood.)      
</p>
<p>
The problem in all the examples above is that the hierarchy is defined <i>both</i> by an attribute of the child <i>and</i> the location of the child 
in relation to other objects. This redundancy causes problems when the structure needs to be changed: the object needs to be both moved and changed.
</p>
   
<p>
The article language I wrote in <i>ngrease</i> is an abstraction of HTML and Latex, but in it sections are defined as a nested hierarchy. This makes
writing and restructuring painless, especially if each section is defined in a separate file, included by its parent: Only <i>one layer thinking</i> is needed when writing
a section, and the article can be restructured simply by moving section references (the "include" expressions), without any need to touch the referenced section
definitions.
