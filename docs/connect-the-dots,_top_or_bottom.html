<h1>connect-the-dots, top or bottom</h1><p>
I have never really decided whether I like <i>top-down</i> or <i>bottom-up</i> more.
<a href="Coding_by_need.html">Coding by need</a> (coding by intention and TDD) seem to point at top-down. On the other hand, I have been most productive with <i>ngrease</i> by
<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1297846.1297921">extracting abstractions</a> from concrete examples, bottom-up.
</p>

<p>
Maybe the two approaches have more in common than at least I have thought. I think they are both special cases of a more general principle.
</p>

<p>
Below is a graph that visualizes the idea. At the top (the "x" on the first line) is a high-level specification. The task is to find a low-level implementation (the "x" on the last line) with a path to the specification so that the implementation satisfies the specification:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
   . . . x . . . . . .

   . . . . . . . . . .

   . . . . . . . . . .

   . . . . . . . . . .

   . . . . . . . . . .

   . . . . . . . . . .

   . . . . . . x . . .
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes all we have is high-level constraints, and we don't know or care about low-level details. In that case (or rather, during it) top-down might be the natural way to solve the problem.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if we have low-level constraints, like reusable modules we want to use or some technical legacy requirements, it might be feasible to do bottom-up.
</p>

<p>
The underlying principle is to <i>connect the dots</i>, in whatever order feels most appropriate, be it top-down or bottom-up or some combination of them. Maybe even connect-somewhere-in-between if we happen to have some framework-level constraints, for example.
</p>

<p>
The second diagram shows the problem after both special cases of this principle have been applied for a while and we have a much smaller subproblem to solve:

   . . . x . . . . . .
          \
   . . . . x . . . . .

   . . . . . . . . . .

   . . . . . x . . . .
              \
   . . . . . . x . . .
