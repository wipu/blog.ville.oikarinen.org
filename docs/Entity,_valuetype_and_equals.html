<h1>Entity, valuetype and equals</h1><p>
There are lots of different classes of equality, but the distinction between <i>entities</i> and <i>valuetypes</i> is probably the most important aspect, since it is commonly needed and I have witnessed some misunderstanding with it.
</p>

<p>
An entity is, by definition, identifiable by its identity. So it's an error to include any other attribute than the identifier in the <code>equals</code> method. A person won't change to another, when the hair colour attribute changes from "brown" to "none", for example. 
</p>

<p>
(There may be some technical reasons, like <i>unit of work</i>, to implement a different <code>equals</code>, but I see this as a technical layer on top of the "actual" entity.)
</p>

<p>
A valuetype, on the other hand, is identifiable by all its observable attributes. So it's an error to omit any of the attributes in the <code>equals</code> method.
