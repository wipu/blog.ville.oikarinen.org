<h1>The aesthetics of complex simplicity</h1><p>
Last week I bought two excellent books, <i>The Art of the Snowflake: A Photographic Album</i> by Kenneth Libbrecht
and <i>Whisky Classified: choosing single malts by flavour</i> by David Wishart.
</p>
   
<p>
I soon realized that it wasn't a coincidence I chose these seemingly different books:
Both describe a complex and aesthetically pleasing result
from simple ingredients and a sensitive, even chaotic process.
</p>
   
<p>
Still, in both cases the chaos is wonderfully under control:
Each snowflake is unique, but its arms are almost identical.
Each distillery produces a unique whisky, but its production is amazinly uniform.
</p>
   
<p>
If controlled chaos and simplicity of fundamentals are not aesthetically pleasing to a programmer, then what is.
