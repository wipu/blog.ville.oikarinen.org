<h1>Automated analysis, hand-picked data</h1>
<p>
<i>Dependency analysis war story #2</i>
</p>

<p>
After we had <a href="http://blog.ville.oikarinen.org/Architecture_design_as_a_graph_layout_problem.html">designed</a> what our project's dependency graph should look like we started evaluating the current status. Certain parts of the code felt too entangled so a dependency analysis would be needed.
</p>

<p>
Fully automatic dependency analysis is useful for the big picture, but at least in this project it didn't help (even a DSM generated by <a href="http://web.sysart.fi/dtangler/">dtangler</a>).
</p>

<p>
Package-level analysis hides essential information, especially if the package structure is messy (i.e. when the code needs analysis most). Class-level analysis either contains too much information or is restricted to one package/module at a time.
</p>

<p>
The analysis needs to be class-level, because that's where the devil is. The classes need to be picked from several packages to see the whole picture. But only the <i>essential</i> classes need to be included so some manual work would be needed.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the actual dependency analysis cannot be manual, because it is too laborous and error-prone and needs to be repeated after each refactoring.
</p>

<p>
So we combined the best parts of manual and automatic: We hand-picked the classes that best represent the essentials of the program. Then we used some simple scripting to analyse the dependencies between them and draw them as a graph.
</p>

<p>
The result was as to-the-point as a hand-drawn picture but reliable and repeatable.
