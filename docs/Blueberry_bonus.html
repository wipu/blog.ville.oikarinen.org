<h1>Blueberry bonus</h1><p>
This was a good year for blueberries. The best spot, the biggest loot and the strongest symptoms of <i>mania</i> ever <b><code>8D</code></b>
</p>

<p>
I didn't always enjoy berry picking like this. It took a lot of unlearning. My generation doesn't <i>have to</i> pick berries.
</p>

<p>
Every spring when we eat the last berries from the previous summer, I promise myself it's really OK if I don't pick new ones. Knowing I <i>will</i> pick them.
And every time I go to the forest I renew this promise. That every single berry is just a nice <i>bonus</i>, a side-effect of enjoying the nature. Knowing I <i>will</i> go mad when I see more blue than green.
</p>

<p>
In my own programming projects, after each session I try to leave some well-defined little task for the next session. Promising myself it's really OK if that's all I get done. The task is often so trivial that it's amusing to wake the computer for something like that. And I complete the task, and a lot more. Starting is the hard part.
</p>

<p>
It's tempting to start requiring the things I know I will do anyway. But that would spoil the <i>fun</i> and I'd start buying blueberries and feel guilty.
